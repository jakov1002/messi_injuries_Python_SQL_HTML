1. Scraped Lionel Messi's injury data from Transfermarkt. 
2. Transformed two columns' data types from the object type to the integer type. 
3. Uploaded the transformed data into a locally hosted PostgreSQL database.
4. Further transformed and manipulated the data for the purposes of Python-based data analysis and visualization.
