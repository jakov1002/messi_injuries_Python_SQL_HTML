1. Scraped Lionel Messi's injury data from Transfermarkt. 
2. Transformed two columns' data types from the object type to the integer type. 
3. Uploaded the transformed data into a locally hosted PostgreSQL database.
4. Further transformed and manipulated the data for the purposes of Python-based data analysis and visualization.
5. Queried the data from point number two with SQL for additional and different insights.

Explanation of the 3 CSV files: 

1.injury_data - raw scraping data

2.messi_injuries - the transformed data which I queried with SQL for additional and different insights 

3.messi_injuries_by_age - the data I used for the purposes of 
Python-based data analysis and visualization

*Used my preferred database administration tool's "set as default" option on the corresponding database and schema when writing SQL queries.
